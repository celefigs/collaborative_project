Aquí están los pasos que deberías seguir sin incluir código:\n","\n","### 1. **Tokenización y Preprocesamiento del Texto**\n","   - **Tokenización**: Convierte el texto en palabras individuales (*unigrams*), o en pares de palabras (*bigrams*). Puedes usar ambos (combinados) según lo que quieras analizar.\n","   - **Eliminar stopwords**: Remueve palabras comunes y sin valor semántico como “el”, “de”, “que”, etc.\n","   - **Lematización**: Reduce las palabras a su forma base (ej., “corriendo” → “correr”).\n","\n","### 2. **División del Conjunto de Datos (Train-Test Split)**\n","   - Antes de aplicar el esquema de ponderación, divide tus datos en un conjunto de entrenamiento y otro de prueba. Generalmente, el 80% para entrenamiento y el 20% para prueba.\n","\n","### 3. **Esquema de Ponderación (Weighting Scheme)**\n","   Aplica uno de los siguientes métodos para convertir el texto en una representación numérica:\n","   - **Count Vectorizer**: Cuenta la frecuencia de aparición de cada palabra.\n","   - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Ajusta la frecuencia de las palabras en relación a cuán comunes son en el conjunto de datos.\n","   - **Mutual Information**: Calcula qué palabras son más informativas para la clasificación.\n","\n","### 4. **Construir el Modelo (Supervised Learning)**\n","   Entrena varios modelos para ver cuál se desempeña mejor. Empieza con:\n","   - **Modelo Base (Baseline Model)**: Entrena un modelo **Naive Bayes** como referencia inicial.\n","   - **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**: Un modelo efectivo para texto.\n","   - **XGBoost**: Un modelo basado en árboles que suele ser más potente, aunque más complejo.\n","   - **Deep Learning (LSTM)**: Si tienes suficiente tiempo y datos, prueba un modelo de red neuronal recurrente LSTM para capturar la secuencia de las palabras.\n","\n","### 5. **Evaluación**\n","   Después de entrenar los modelos, evalúa su rendimiento en el conjunto de prueba usando métricas como *accuracy*, *precision*, *recall* o *F1 score*.\n","\n","---\n","\n","El objetivo es comparar los modelos para ver cuál ofrece los mejores resultados con tu dataset. \n","\n","¡Sí, puedes agregar un **pipeline**! Esto te permite encadenar varios pasos del preprocesamiento y el modelado de forma organizada y reproducible. El pipeline incluiría la tokenización, el esquema de ponderación, y el modelo de machine learning en una única estructura. Así, puedes aplicar todo el flujo a tu conjunto de datos de manera automática.\n","\n","### ¿Qué estarás prediciendo?\n","Dado que en tu dataset tienes una columna de **rating**, parece que el objetivo es predecir el **rating** basado en la **review**. Esto significa que tu problema es de **regresión**, ya que estarás prediciendo un valor continuo (el rating, que va de 1 a 10, por ejemplo).\n","\n","### Pasos para el **Pipeline**:\n","\n","1. **Preprocesamiento de texto**:\n","   - Tokenización.\n","   - Remoción de stopwords.\n","   - Lematización.\n","\n","2. **Esquema de Ponderación**: \n","   - Usa **TF-IDF** o **CountVectorizer** para convertir las palabras a valores numéricos.\n","\n","3. **Modelo**:\n","   - Comienza con un modelo base como **Naive Bayes** o **Regresión Lineal**.\n","   - Luego, prueba modelos más avanzados como **SVM**, **XGBoost** o **LSTM** si es necesario.\n","\n","4. **Evaluación del Modelo**:\n","   - Como el objetivo es predecir ratings (regresión), usa métricas como **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** o **R^2** para evaluar el rendimiento del modelo.\n","\n","### Estructura del Pipeline\n","Con un pipeline, todas estas etapas se ejecutarán secuencialmente sobre tus datos. Además, puedes usar **GridSearchCV** para ajustar los hiperparámetros del modelo de manera más eficiente.\n","\n","---\n","\n","En resumen, estarías prediciendo el **rating** de las revisiones y puedes aplicar un pipeline para automatizar el flujo completo desde el preprocesamiento hasta la predicción."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"data-science","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
