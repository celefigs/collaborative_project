I have gained about 13 lbs so far since getting the birth control. Although for now the weight gain isn&#039;t a deal breaker for me but the bleeding is..  I am trying to be very patient to see how my body adjusts to the implant. It has been three months so far and I have my fingers crossed that my cycle will go away for awhile.\"   \n",

I&#039;ve been on Birth Control for about 10 years now. I changed due to spotting and increased mood swings with my previous birth control. Since the switch I have had shorter periods about 2-3 days, but I have gained major weight and increased appetite. I switched up my regular exercise routine and still have not managed to drop the extra 7 lbs ;(\"   \n",
